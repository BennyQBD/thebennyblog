Hello everyone! It's Benny!

Yes, I've returned. I've perhaps returned a bit later than I expected (and in a different format), but I have returned nevertheless.

You'll be glad to know I have not been idle since my last video. Far from it; I've been working on quite a few interesting things that I'm very excited to share with you.

But unfortunately, I can't share them all at once. And I'm not even saying that as a teaser: I mean I *literally* cannot do it. Believe me, I tried. Multiple times. Over the course of close to a year (!) at this point.

Every video I attempted to make covering everything was projected to be close to an hour or longer and *still* didn't cover what I wanted to in any satisfactory amount of detail. And meanwhile, I was still working, still steadily accumulating even more things that needed fair representation.

So in short, the whole "return video" plan was an unmitigated disaster. Oops.

That's the biggest part of the answer to the first question you probably have. Namely, why on earth is Benny crazy enough to try starting an invisible blog in the abyss of the internet instead of just posting another video?

Well, videos didn't work for this. So unorthodox times call for unorthodox measures. We'll see how that turns out, but *something* different is required for this, so this blog detour is progress if nothing else.

As for all these exciting things I've mentioned... stay tuned. If all goes according to plan, you'll be seeing some of the new materials on this blog in the near future.

Either way, it's great to talk to you again, and I look forward to seeing you soon.

<br/>
'Til then,<br/>
Benny<br/><br/>
